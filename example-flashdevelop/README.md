FlashDevelop example
====================

To use this example:

* Make sure the SDKs in `C:\Program Files (x86)\FlashDevelop\Tools\ascsdk` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\FlashDevelop\Tools\flexsdk` are up-to-date; you need at least AIR 4 SDK to use this ANE
* Copy the ANE to `extensions` folder
* Create `bin` and `dist` folders, if they don't exist
* Open `ImmersiveModeTest.as3proj` in FlashDevelop
* Build the project
* Run `PackageApp.bat`
* Install `dist/ImmersiveModeTest.apk` on your device (if it hasn't already installed automatically)
* That's it!

You should have no problems using the ANE without renaming it or extracting the files, as is often suggested online.
